	<p> Sometimes a game can just click with you. Everything about it just captivates you and makes you feel like you are playing
        something truly special. This was very much the case for myself with the remake of Silent Hill 2. I had been quite interested in
        the original PS2 version for sometime before this remake, although I never actually played it. I had listened to some of the music from
        it which really intrigued me, and had seen shots of the bleak foggy environments and absurdly creepy enemy designs which also really appealed to me. 
        So, when the remake was announced I knew it was a great opportunity to finally give it a shot. I can get pretty damn scared playing horror games, therefore, I
        tend to only really play one every few years, I can probably list them all now... Resident Evil 7, Resident Evil 2 Remake, Outlast, Dead Space
        & most recently a short indie game called Mouthwashing. So, although my horror resume is fairly limited, I've still played a few of the classics.
        I can comfortably say this is the scariest and best horror game I've ever played and a new all-time favourite video game in general.

    </p>



		
	<p> 
        Without spoiling anything in this review, the basic premise for the story and gameplay is that the character you play as, James, recieves
        a letter from his wife Mary, asking him to come meet her at their 'special place' in Silent Hill. The catch being, his wife died not long ago from a
        sickening disease. Instantly I was hooked. Such an intriguing and curious opening to a story that had me wanting to know more and made it very hard to put
        down the controller. The game begins with James arriving in Silent Hill, as his journey to find this special place and maybe even his wife begins. 

    </p>

    <p>
        The first thing I wanted to talk about was how the story is told. There aren't that many cutscenes in the game, a lot of the storytelling is done through
        the environment as well as little bits of lore you can find through letters or newspaper articles scattered throughout the game. I really loved how the story remains a 
        mystery for most of its 20 hour run-time. It drip feeds you information slowly and keeps you wondering what the hell is going on with this town. A lot of the story
        and lore is told very cryptically through symbolism and contains a lot of hidden meaning. I found myself so intrigued and confused at the same time. Nothing was making sense
        to me but that made it all the more fun and kept me really fascinated.

    </p>

	<figure><img src="Images/sh32.JPG"><figcaption>A lot of the detail and lore in the story is found through reading left behind letters and writings on the walls. There meaning not clear until
		you finish the game.
	</figcaption></figure>
	

	<p>
		This is a story that touches on some extremely serious themes. If I was to shortly sum it up, it's a story about how we cope with trauma in our lives.
		It doesn't play it safe or try to be subtle with these sensitive topics either, not holding back at all when it comes to the intimate details and characters
		back stories. Considering the time the original came out, in the early 2000's, I assume a video game story like this would of been very avant-garde. 
		Even today, I personally have never experienced a story quite like this one in a video game format before. As a pretty big RPG fan, I'm more used to playing games in which I'm
		some hero defending the world from evil. Whereas here, I'm playing as some quiet & ordinary guy who just wants to find his wife in a creepy abandonded town. It was quite a refreshing experience and one that felt
		extremely raw.
	</p>

	<figure><img src="Images/shnew1.JPG"><figcaption>The character Angela was a huge standout to me. She's a great example of just how dark the story is willing to go.

	<p>
        Cutscenes come few and far between. There will always be a whole lot of puzzles, fighting and exploring before you get to your next cutscene, which made them feel very rewarding and all the more special.
		The game also keeps you on edge the entire time, there is rarely a moment of solitude unless you just stand still. So cutscenes also offer a much needed break from the fear.
        Every single cutscene had me absolutely glued to the screen... The background ambient music that draws you in, the unbelievably authentic performance from the cast, and the bizarre yet truly absorbing writing ~ it
        all combines to creates a very surreal feeling. The writing in particular felt super uncanny. You will meet a few other characters during your time in Silent Hill and all of them catch you off guard. 
        It just feels so strange that anybody else would be in this town. But when James meets them for the first time, he never seems too fazed. Conversations feel very mundane at times,
        which strikingly contrasts with the unexplainable craziness that surrounds them. The dialogue, particulary during the first half of the game, is all very soft and quiet. It's quite relaxing hearing them chat and
        it acts as a nice break from the exhausting and terrifying chaos you've just dragged yourself through. As the game progresses and the story unfolds, cutscenes become more and more dramatic.
        There are a few towards the end that are absolute cinema. With some lines of dialogue and imagery that will stick with me forever. If you're too scared to play the game yourself, I highly recommend just watching
        the cutscenes to see what I mean!
    </p> 


		<figure><img src="Images/sh216.JPG"><figcaption>Cutscenes in this game gave such a strange feeling... an unusual mix of melancholy and dread. </figcaption></figure>
		
        
        <p>I must now talk about the main character James. The performance by actor Luke Roberts is absolute perfection. It takes the cake as my favourite performance in a video game ever.
            I don't know what it was, it's very hard to describe why I liked this character so much. He seems eager and full of hope to find his wife Mary, but there's also this underlying 
            sadness to him. He's both calm and unsettled, composed and broken. Even though at face value he's a very simple character, looking back now... there are also so many subtle layers to him.  
			During dialogue, his voice is very soft spoken and solemn, like he isn't fully there, just... on auto-pilot. 
            It makes every conversation feel like a fever dream. Also, as the game progresses, you can see in his eyes and facial expressions just how exhausted he becomes, as if he really doesn't care anymore.
            I'm sorry if I don't make much sense here. His performance just completely captured me. He's confused alongside you about what on earth is going on.  He's a huge reason I loved this game so much.
      </p>

	  <p>
		Another absolute highlight for me was the environments. So amazingly immersive. You get a great variety of different places to explore during your playthrough. 
		The first and most famous is the foggy streets of Silent Hill. An abandoned town swamped with fog. Every corner you turned was into the unknown. Enemies slowly stumbling towards you out of the fog. 
		It made exploration feel constantly suspenseful. I interpret the fog as ....
	  </p>
		
		<figure><img src="Images/totk_unlockfairy.JPG"><figcaption>It took me forever to unlock some key upgrades in the game. Most significantly was the Great Fairy. It requires you to head to the outskirts of Rito Village to unlock a side quest, that then unlocks further side quests, 
		that once completed, finally unlocks the Great Fairy. </figcaption></figure>
		
		
		
		
		
		<figure><img src="Images/totk_shelterfromrain.JPG"><figcaption>All the small little moments outside of the story, combat and puzzles ~ like finding cozy little spots to rest, were always my favourite moments playing the game.</figcaption></figure>
		
		<p>The music is beautiful. It re-uses a lot of the stuff from Breath of the Wild but still has enough new music to enjoy. One track that stood out for me was the music that played as you dived into one of the chasms. As link glides down into the
		underground depths you hear this loud trombone howling... it is quite surreal and makes you feel like you've entered a new world. The music up in the Sky is also one of my favourites. It's this soft saxophone that quietly hums in the background. 
		Otherwise, when travelling on ground, you hear light piano ambience that beautifuly compliments the sound of nature around you. Also, a special mention to the 4 temples having different phases depending on how much you had advanced through the puzzles.
		The music adds extra layers each time you progress through a stage of the temple. Very cool stuff. The only track I didn't really like was the combat music. It was just clunky, loud and annoying. </p>

		<figcaption>Feel free to listen along to the Sky Islands theme as you continue reading my review. I love how soothing and comforting it sounds. Reminds me of the music in Limgrave from Elden Ring... just a less sinister and a more happier version</figcaption></figure></div>
		<p>Tears of the Kingdom adds a few new places to explore that weren't there in Breath of the Wild. Firstly, the addition of the Sky Islands was genius. Seeing the land below you and all the landmarks
		you've already been to from up above just blew me away. Seeing the whole of Hyrule all at once made the world feel more alive, like it was all living on without Link. The autumn colour palette they used up in the Sky Islands
		was also very pretty, especially when the suns light beamed down, only adding to the vibe. It was such a smart way to expand the map. Flying and gliding through the sky from island
		to island while taking in all the views was simply stunning. It was truly magical and one of the best parts of the game.</p><p>Caves are another new addition to the map and there are SO many of them... hiding behind waterfalls & blending in with the natural terrain. 
		These reminded me a lot of the catacombs in Elden Ring, mini dungeons/puzzles that reward you with loot at their end. They also acted as underground passages that linked different points of the map seamlessly. 
		One cave I entered from the sunny green lands nearby Hateno Village and exited on the other side into the snowy Mount Lanayru. It made the map feel so natural and interconnected.</p>
		<figure><img src="Images/totk_skyislands.JPG"><figcaption>The world looked so beautiful from up above. The sunny orange lighting was always so beautiful. Looking down from above and seeing the areas you've previously travelled from a new perspective was really amazing.
			It also made you realise just how massive this map is.
		</figcaption></figure>
		
		<p>Another one of the biggest new additions to the game was the underground depths. You enter these by diving down into a multitude of chasms found in various locations across the map. The entire above ground map is replicated down below. 
		Every shrine in the game has it's root found directly below it in the depths. So in essense, they doubled the size of the map ~ which is crazy impressive in itself. But I never really enjoyed being down there. For starters, it is completely pitch black down there, 
		you get around by throwing or shooting these plants that lights up the area it lands. I found this a little bit annoying, every 20 seconds having to shoot or throw another plant...but hey it added to the atmosphere down there. So, what's there to do? You can find some pretty cool ruins, yiga hideouts, 
		unique enemies and enhanced bosses as well as valuable materials. But I would always spend 5 minutes down there before getting tired or bored and wanting to head back up. Even when I tried to stay down there for longer periods, I would often get stuck at dead ends. Different parts of the map seemed cut off from each other by walls. 
		It just felt like a much more boring version of the game. You couldn't ignore it completely too as Zonaite Deposits were only found here ~ which are needed to use Auto-Build. It looked really bland, ugly and repetitive too. Once again, the idea in practice sounds really cool to me and I'm a little suprised I didn't like it. Something about it to me just felt uninspired. By the end of the game, I had seen maybe 30-40% of depths
		and had no motivation to see any more. </p>

		<figure><img src="Images/totk_underground depths.JPG"><figcaption>I only have one screenshot from my time down in the underground depths, and I think it was an accidental one. Compared to the beauty up above on soil, it was all so ugly and bland. It always felt like a chore to explore down there.</figcaption></figure>
		
		
		<p>For a game that has such a strong emphasis on exploration, it's important to ensure getting around the map is easy and fun, which Tears of the Kingdom absolutely does. 
		One of the new abilities Link has is Fuse, which essentially allows you to combine any of the different objects you find in the game. The game also introduces tools called Zonai Devices,
		which include things like wheels, wings, fans, rockets, balloons, springs, sleds and steering sticks. So, Link can fuse these devices with one another, for example, a Wing with a fan attached at the back and a steering stick allows 
		you to fly around the Sky. Or attaching a rocket to your shield allows you to blast yourself upwards saving you from slowly climbing up a mountain. You can also use Fuse on natural objects such as tree trunks or wooden planks. I often
		fused wooden planks with a fan and a steering stick to make a raft for crossing water. This allowed you to be creative and unique about how you wanted to get somewhere. It turned the game into a sandbox as there were infinite possibilites with
		what you could build to get around.</p>

		<figure><img src="Images/totk_boatcave.JPG">An example of the fuse function ~ here I fused a washed ashore boat found on an island with fans and a steering stick so I could make my way into this hidden cave.<figcaption></figcaption></figure>
		
		<p> Now, although I do believe this should of been a great addition to the game, I personally didn't love it in practice. I often found myself sticking to walking/running or using my horse as much as possible. 
		Building quickly became a chore for me. The game really encourages you a lot of the time to build and I found it always took me out of the flow of exploration I mentioned earlier. It just became an annoyance for me. The act of building itself 
		felt very clunky. A lot of the time I didn't have enough room to move and rotate certain objects into the right position, or the camera would get in the way, or objects I took out of my inventory would go sliding down a hill, or I would
		accidentally put a part in the wrong place and have to take it off by shaking the joystick and re-attaching it again. Building took a decent
		30 seconds to a minute at times. You can unlock auto-build which does make building a lot easier and quicker but a lot of those annoying quirks I mentioned still remained for me, and as mentioned before, I personally didn't unlock it until very late in the game.
		For myself, the idea was very cool and it forced you to think in creative ways, but it just wasn't implemented well enough in my opinion. Of course, you can try ignore building as much as possible, but there are many times where you are 
		pretty much forced to build. Like I said in my intro, the thing I loved about Breath of the Wild was its simplicity and how the map itself was the playground and you could only use what you found in front of you. Tears of the Kingdom loses 
		this simplicity a little bit with the addition of Zonai Devices and building. </p>

		<figure><img src="Images/totk_flyingplane.JPG"><figcaption>Flying above the clouds with the sun in the horizon. Not something you get to experience in many games, especially RPG/action games.  </figcaption></figure>
		
		<p>I... didn't like the combat either. In Breath of the Wild, I thought it was fine. I don't remember getting too frustrated. Maybe, I was willing too look past some of the issues as I was seeing that incredible version of Hyrule for the first time.
		Breakable weapons/weapon durability makes its return in Tears of the Kindgom, and I hated it. It's something that didn't bother me at all in Breath of the Wild but for whatever reason this time it did. Weapons are so incredibly weak. I think
		on average you might get 5 or 6 combos in before your weapon breaks. Having your weapon break mid fight, just felt so disruptive. I understand it's part of the identity of the game and that's fine, but they really needed to increase the durability 
		of the weapons to last longer than 1 or 2 fights. Not to mention, enemies in this game have way too much HP... like unnecessarily high HP. Unless your weapon has at least 40 attack power, you can be constantly hitting enemies over and over without them dying.
		I could go through 2 or 3 weapons when fighting some of the harder enemies in the game. The combat just felt boring. Parrying was never worth it as the window for attacking after a successful parry was way too small. A lot of the time you are just dodging at the last moment for a flurry attack, which slows down the combat a lot. 
		Combat doesn't evolve itself at all from the first hour of the game to the last. Towards the end I was just running past enemies looking to avoid combat. To be fair, I didn't utilise some of the new Zonai devices that can also be used in combat. But, building some
		contraption before each fight didn't seem worth the time. </p>

		<figure><img src="Images/totk_combat.JPG"><figcaption>Combat gets the job done and is serviceable but never evolves throughout the game. Every encounter felt the same.</figcaption></figure>

		
		
		<p>I also quickly want to mention the menu system. I found it ridiculous that in order to heal, you had to pause the game, go into the menu and eat a meal. Yes it is obviously easy enough but surely they could off added a quick menu or some kind of hotbar that allows
		you to use items or meals while in play. Pausing all the time was just another example of slowing down the pace of combat. It would of been a solid quality of life improvement over the first game. Also a huge nit-pick, but the simple ability to be at the top of your inventory and press up
		to go to the bottom of your inventory instead of scrolling down for 10 seconds would of been nice too...</p>
		
		<figure><img src="Images/totk_snowyhouse.JPG"><figcaption>A cozy hut found in the snowy regions outside Rito village</figcaption></figure>
		
		<p>I won't go to deep into the story. I thought it was fine enough. It has some nice cutscenes that deepen the lore of Hyrule's past. It has some really amazing moments too, in particular to do with Princess Zelda and the master sword. The ending is also phenomenal. However, it has a lot off fluff too.
		Going to each region and defeating the boss leads to the same revelation every time. You get a copy and paste cutscene that explains what we already knew after the first region. You can also find 12 dragon tears spread around the map that each give you a flashback cutscene explaining everything that happened
		up until this point. I would highly suggest looking up a guide to watch these in the correct order. </p>

		<figure><img src="Images/totk_sidequest.JPG"><figcaption>The game has some fantastic side quests. Including one of my favourite ones ever. Involving helping a young Gerudo leave her family to spend time in Gerudo village as per their races tradition. 
			Once I eventually visited Gerudo village, I found her there and she recognised me! Amazing world building
		</figcaption></figure>
		
		<p>I hate to sound super negative about the game. I realise I spent a lot of this review mentioning so much about what I didn't like. But don't get me wrong. The game is utterly incredible. It's an adventure I would recommend to everyone. Also,
		as much as I love Breath of the Wild ~ I don't think I could ever go back. I know I've preached how much I prefer its simplicity... but quite simply Tears of the Kingdom is a better game in every way. While most of the new additions didn't really work for me,
		they flesh out the game and let players decide how they want to play the game. It provides even more freedom than BOTW which I didn't think was possible. Going back would feel so limiting. Which is exactly what a sequel should strive for. And, for the first 50 hours of the game, I was telling myself this was going to be one of my 
		favourite games of all time. Sadly though, I just couldn't ignore some of the underlying issues this time around as the wow factor started to dwindle. I think that was a big part of the problem actually. I just spent too much time in the game. I had a fear of missing out and wanted to see and do everything. But there was no need for that,
		the game doesn't force or encourage you to do everything. I think I became burnt out towards the back half of the game and had less patience for the games flaws. I still have amazing memories with this game though and hope this review encourages you to give it a try! </p>
